Description
-----------

This is a completely self-contained reference implementation of the EEM and ACKS2 models
as they are implemented in the ReaxFF model. Many examples are provided to generate
reference data that can be used to validate the charges obtained with full-blown ReaxFF
implementations.


Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.7
* Numpy >= 1.0


How to run an example
---------------------

Just type the following on the command line:

    ./compute_charges.py {eem,acks2} reaxff_parameter_file {XYZ,PDB}

Energy (due to charges) and charges are just printed on screen.
